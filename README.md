Research Objectives The primary objective of this study is to analyze supply chain data to understand delivery performance and identify opportunities to reduce late deliveries, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. The specific objectives are:

To evaluate the overall delivery performance of the supply chain by analyzing delivery status, shipping duration, and late-delivery occurrences.
To identify the key factors influencing delivery delays, including shipping mode, product category, order characteristics, and geographical location.
To examine the relationship between delivery performance and business outcomes, such as sales revenue and profitability.
To compare delivery performance across different markets, regions, and product categories to identify areas requiring operational improvement.
To develop a predictive model for late-delivery risk using historical supply chain data and relevant operational variables.
To assess the impact of late deliveries on customer satisfaction and overall supply chain efficiency.
To provide data-driven recommendations that can help reduce delivery delays, improve logistics performance, and support strategic decision-making.

## 🗂️ Data Dictionary

The dataset consists of the following 10 features:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Order_ID** | String | A unique alphanumeric identifier for each transaction. | `ORD078` |
| **Date** | Date | The transaction date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. | `2026-04-09` |
| **Product** | String | The name of the electronic item sold. | `Laptop`, `Mouse`, `Webcam` |
| **Category** | String | The high-level category classification. | `Electronics` |
| **Region** | String | The geographic sales territory. | `North`, `East`, `West`, `South` |
| **Salesperson** | String | The name of the account representative. | `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`, `Diana`, `Ethan` |
| **Quantity** | Integer | The total units purchased in the order. | `7.0` |
| **Unit_Price** | Float | The retail price per single unit of the product. | `997.67` |
| **Discount** | Float | The promotional deduction percentage applied (0.0 to 0.15). | `0.15` (equivalent to 15%) |
| **Sales** | Float | The final calculated gross revenue earned from the order. | `6983.69` |

## 🔍 Data Quality & Cleaning Notes

If you are using this dataset for data cleaning projects, please note that it intentionally contains realistic real-world data anomalies:
* **Missing Values (NaNs):** Features like `Region`, `Salesperson`, `Unit_Price`, `Discount`, and `Sales` contain scattered missing fields (e.g., missing revenue values or unattributed regional boundaries).
* **Calculated Columns:** The `Sales` column follows the general formula:  
  \[\text{Sales} = (\text{Quantity} \times \text{Unit\_Price}) \times (1 - \text{Discount})\]
  This relationship can be exploited to programmatically restore missing metrics.
* **Empty Rows:** The raw structure contains blank structural divider rows (`,,,,,,,,,`) that should be filtered out during preprocessing.

## 🛠️ Usage Example (Python & Pandas)

Get started analyzing this dataset quickly using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset and drop completely empty structural lines
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv').dropna(how='all')

# Convert date column to datetime object
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Quick view of total sales revenue by product
revenue_by_product = df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("Revenue by Product:\n", revenue_by_product)
```

## 💡 Potential Projects & Analysis Directions
1. **Sales Performance Dashboards:** Create interactive Tableau or Power BI visualizations mapping regional performance by salesperson.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Build machine learning regression models to predict expected order values or customer quantity demands.
3. **Discount Impact Studies:** Assess whether offering a $10\%$ vs $15\%$ discount yields a statistically significant increase in total items sold.
